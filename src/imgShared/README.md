Note for me:

Put only images here which are shared by multiple components (excluding SVG icons, which go into `src/components/Icons`).

---

- Images only used on one page belong into the folder of that page.
- Images only used by one component belong into the folder of that component.
- Images included by the page shell or by the non-React SSG template go into `public/`
